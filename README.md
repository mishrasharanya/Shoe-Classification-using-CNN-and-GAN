# Shoe-Classification-using-CNN-and-GAN
In this, we took image datasets of various shoe companies and trained our system using CNN  (Convolution Neural Network) and a multiclass classification system. We further expanded the scope of the project by using it as a system to generate new shoe designs using GAN (Generative Analysis Network).
